title: "FPL Monte Carlo Simulation for Draws"

There have been 14 games played so far and my current record is 6/5/3 - 5 draws sees highly improbable given the range of possible scores the home team and away team can have each week.

Have used ChatGPT to generate some code to run this through a montecarlo simulation.

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(readxl)  # For reading Excel files
library(ggplot2) # For plotting
library(dplyr)   # For data manipulation
library(tidyr)   # For reshaping data

# Step 1: Read data from Excel
file_path <- "FPL Home and Away Scores.xlsx"  # Update this with your file's path
scores <- read_excel(file_path)

# Step 2: Generate distribution graphs
plot1 <- ggplot(scores, aes(x = Home)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "blue", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Home Scores", x = "Score", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()

plot2 <- ggplot(scores, aes(x = Away)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "red", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Away Scores", x = "Score", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()

plot1
plot2

# Step 3: Analyze the distributions
home_mean <- mean(scores$Home)
home_sd <- sd(scores$Home)
away_mean <- mean(scores$Away)
away_sd <- sd(scores$Away)

cat("Home Mean:", home_mean, "Home SD:", home_sd, "\n")
cat("Away Mean:", away_mean, "Away SD:", away_sd, "\n")

# Step 4: Define simulation parameters
#set.seed(123) # For reproducibility, don't think want a seed as want it to generate new random numbers for each distribution
n_simulations <- 100000
n_fixtures <- 14  # simulate 14 fixtures for a player

# Initialize variables
exact_match_count <- 0
max_draws <- 0  # To track the maximum number of draws observed
max_draw_simulation <- NULL  # Store the simulation results with the maximum draws

# Step 5: Run Monte Carlo simulations
for (i in 1:n_simulations) {
  # Generate simulated scores as integers
  home_simulated <- round(rnorm(n_fixtures, mean = home_mean, sd = home_sd))
  away_simulated <- round(rnorm(n_fixtures, mean = away_mean, sd = away_sd))
  
  # Determine outcomes
  results <- data.frame(
    Home_Score = home_simulated,
    Away_Score = away_simulated
  ) %>%
    mutate(
      Result = case_when(
        abs(Home_Score - Away_Score) == 0 ~ "Draw",
        Home_Score > Away_Score ~ "Home Win",
        TRUE ~ "Away Win"
      )
    )
  
  # Count results
  result_summary <- results %>%
    count(Result) %>%
    spread(Result, n, fill = 0) %>%
    mutate(
      Wins = ifelse("Home Win" %in% colnames(.), `Home Win`, 0),
      Draws = ifelse("Draw" %in% colnames(.), Draw, 0),
      Losses = ifelse("Away Win" %in% colnames(.), `Away Win`, 0)
    )
  
  # Check for exact match
  if (result_summary$Wins == 6 & result_summary$Draws == 5 & result_summary$Losses == 3) {
    exact_match_count <- exact_match_count + 1
  }
  
    # Update maximum draws
  if (result_summary$Draws > max_draws) {
    max_draws <- result_summary$Draws
    max_draw_simulation <- results  # Store the results of this simulation
  }
  
   # Add progress message every 1,000 iterations
  if (i %% 1000 == 0) {
    message(sprintf("Completed %d/%d simulations", i, n_simulations))
  }
}

# Step 6: Calculate probability
probability <- exact_match_count / n_simulations
cat("Likelihood of 6 Wins, 5 Draws, 3 Losses:", probability, "\n")




```
